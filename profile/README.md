# FUNGUS

FUNGUS is a tool for detecting source code plagiarism in ARMv7 programming assignments. It was developed for the capstone project (ECSE 458) at McGill University, under the supervision of [Prof. Christophe Dubach](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/christophe-dubach). It is inspired by Stanford's [Measure of Software Similarity](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) (Moss).
